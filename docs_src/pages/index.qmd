`simplextree` is a Python package aimed at simplifying computation for general simplicial complexes of any dimension. This package facilitates this aim by providing bindings to a Simplex Tree data structure implemented using modern C++ and exported an [extension module](https://docs.python.org/3/extending/extending.html). 
<!-- The underlying library implementation also exports a C++ header, which can be specified as a dependency and used in other packages. -->

The Simplex Tree was originally introduced in the following paper:

> Boissonnat, Jean-Daniel, and Cl√©ment Maria. "The simplex tree: An efficient data structure for general simplicial complexes." Algorithmica 70.3 (2014): 406-427.

A Simplex Tree is an ordered, trie-like structure whose nodes are in bijection with the faces of the complex. Here's a picture (taken from the paper) of a simplicial 3-complex (left) and its corresponding Simplex Tree (right):
