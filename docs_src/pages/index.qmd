`simplextree` is an Python package that simplifies computation for general [simplicial complexes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplicial_complex) of any dimension by providing [pybind11](https://github.com/pybind/pybind11) bindings to a _Simplex Tree_ data structure implemented in modern C++17. 

A _Simplex Tree_ is an ordered, [trie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trie)-like structure whose nodes are in bijection with the faces of the complex. Here's a picture of a simplicial 3-complex (left) and its corresponding Simplex Tree (right):

The _Simplex Tree_ was originally introduced in the following paper:

> Boissonnat, Jean-Daniel, and Clément Maria. "The simplex tree: An efficient data structure for general simplicial complexes." Algorithmica 70.3 (2014): 406-427.

The `SimplexTree` class exported by the package includes support for many tree operations, e.g. insertions, removals, expansions, collapses, star/link enumerations, and other traversals. 

## Install 

The easiest way to install the package is via the platform-specific [wheels](https://pythonwheels.com/) on [pypi](https://pypi.org/project/simplextree/). 

```bash 
python -m pip install simplextree 
```

You can also `pip install` the package manually by downloading the appropriate wheel (or sdist) from the [releases](https://github.com/peekxc/simplextree-py/releases/). 

For installation instructions for developers looking to extend the package, see [Building & Developing](#building--developing). 

## Building & Developing 

If you would like to build the package yourself for development reasons, a typical workflow is to install the [build-time dependencies](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/reference/build-system/pyproject-toml/#build-time-dependencies) first: 

```bash
python -m pip install meson-python ninja pybind11 numpy
```

Then, build and install the package in [editable mode](https://peps.python.org/pep-0660/) (see also [meson-python notes](https://meson-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/how-to-guides/editable-installs.html)), optionally without build isolation for speed:

```bash
python -m pip install --no-build-isolation --editable .
```

Unit testing is handled with [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/7.4.x/). See the [gh-workflows](https://github.com/peekxc/simplextree-py/actions) for platform-specific configuration. 

## Native Extensions 

The underlying C++ library is [header-only](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Header-only) and may be included as a dependency by [extension modules](https://docs.python.org/3/extending/extending.html) in other Python packages.

Thus, to modify or extending the complex in C++, it is sufficient to add the package as a build-time dependency and append the include directory to the compilation target.
